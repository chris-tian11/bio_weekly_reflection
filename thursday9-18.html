    <ul>
        <li>Why is carbon so important?:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Carbon atoms have 4 valence electrons, allowing it to form strong covalent bonds with many other elements</li>
            <li>1 carbon atom can bond to another, which gives carbon the ability to form chains that can almost span to an infinite length</li>
        </ul>
        <li>No other element matches carbon's versatility and ability to build</li>
        <li>The large organic molecules found in living things are known as macromolecules (giant moleculte)</li>
        <li>Macromolecules are created from monomers which join together to create polymers</li>
        <li>4 major groups of macromolecules are found in living things</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Carbohydrates</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Ex: sugar, starch, and cellulose</li>
                <li>Made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, usually in a ratio of 1:2:1</li>
                <li>The breakdown of sugars apply immediate energy for the cell</li>
                <li>Many organisms store extra sugar as complex carbohydrates known as starch</li>
                <li>Simple Sugars:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simple sugar molecules area slo known as monosaccharides</li>
                    <li>Besides glucose, monosaccharides include galactose and fructose</li>
                    <li>A disaccharide is a compound made by joining together 2 simple sugars, fructose and glucose</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Complex Carbohydrates:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The macromolecules formed by joining many monosaccharides together is called a polysaccharide</li>
                    <li>Many animals store excess sugar in a polysaccharide called glycogen which is used to supply energy for muscle contraction</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Starches and Cellulose:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Plants use a different polysaccharide to store excess sugar called starch</li>
                    <li>Plants make an important polysaccharide called cellulose</li>
                    <li>Cellulose fibers give plants their strength and rigidity</li>
                    <li>Cellulose is the major component of paper and wood</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Lipids</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Large and varied group of macromolecules</li>
                <li>Not soluble in water</li>
                <li>Made mostly from carbon and hydrogen atoms</li>
                <li>Lipids include the compounds we call fats, oils, and waxes</li>
                <li>Lipids can be used to store energry, and they form important parts of biological membranes and waterproof coverings</li>
                <li>Many lipids form when glycerol combines with compounds called fatty acids</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Nucleic Acids</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Nucleotides are monomers that consist of three components:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>5-carbon sugar</li>
                    <li>Phosphate group</li>
                    <li>Nitrogenous base</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Nucleic acids are polymers assembled from nucleotides</li>
                <li>Nucleoides can be joined together by covalent bonds to form a polynucleotide or a nucleic acid</li>
                <li>There are 2 types of nucleic acids:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>DNA</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contains the sugar deoxyribose</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>RNA</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contains the sugar ribose</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Proteins</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Contains nitrogens, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen</li>
                <li>Proteins are monomers of molecule called amino acids</li>
                <li>Amino acids are compounds with an amino group on one end and a carboxyl group on the other</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
