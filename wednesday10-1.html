    <h1>Enzyme Lab - Design an Experiment</h1>
    <h2>(Summary of class notes/lab)</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Today in class, we started our lab that we designed. After Ethan and I got our procedure from last class signed, we created our result table. On our table, we had the pH on the left side, and the amount of glucose on the right side, with basic, acidic, and neutral, labeling the rows.
        We then filled 3 beakers with 50 ml of water, water and baking soda (for the basic solution), and vinegar (for the acidic solution). We then poured 30 ml of milk into each of the beakers for the lactose. Next, we measured the pH of each of the solutions and recoreded each of them under their respected acidity (basic, acidic, and neutral).
        For our pH for each of the solutions, we got 8.0 for basic, 3.0 for acidic, and 7.0 for neutral. We then grinded up 3 half lactaid pills and put each half into one of the solutions. After putting them in, we tested for a reaction using a glucose test strip. For the basic solution, we got 100 mg/dl. For the acidic solution we got negative. Lastly, for the neutral solution we got 500 mg/dl. 
        From our results, we were able to conclude that when the pH is far from neutral (7.0), a reaction does not occur. For example, our pH of our acidic solution was 3.0, which is far from neutral. The amount of glucose was negative, meaning that no reaction occured.
