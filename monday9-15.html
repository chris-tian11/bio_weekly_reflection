    <h1>Nutrients Lab Part 2</h1>
    <h2>(Summary of class notes/lab)</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Today we used the knowledge from Part 1 of the lab to solve a murder case involving foods at different restaurants. We needed to test what the victim ate before they got murdered to figure out what restaurant they were in, resulting in knowing who they ate with (the killer). In part 1, we figured out that carbohydrates (specifically simple sugars) mixed with water and 10 drops of Benedicts make a dark orange color on the top. When we added in the stomach mixture with the water and the Benedicts, we saw a positive reaction. This means that the victim ate simple sugars at the restaurant. Next, we tested starch using water and 2 drops of iodine. This was also a positive result (turned black), which told us that the victim also had starch in their meal before death. Next we tested for proteins with 5 drops of Biuret, which resulted in no change/negative result. Lastly, we tested for lipids using Sudan IV, which came out to have red clumps on the top, meaning a positive result. This concludes that the victim ate simple sugars, starch, and lipids at the restaurant. The reason we did not test for nucleic acids is because most foods contain nucleic acids (it would not give us useful information). The only restaurant where the victim ate simple sugars, starch, and lipids was Buon Amici, which the victim's girlfriend was also at. This means that the killer was the victim's girlfriend.</p>
